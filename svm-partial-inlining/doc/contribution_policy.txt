Sable-UQAM Contribution Policy 2.0
==================================

This document outlines the policy on contributions to Sable-UQAM
projects.

In the text below, "Sable-UQAM projects" means the whole software
project collection, including SableVM, SableCC, and other software
projects managed by the project.

In order to accept your contribution, the Sable-UQAM Research Group
requires that you confirm the following:

1- You have maintained a "clean-room" status with respect to all work
you contribute to Sable-UQAM projects.

 Explanations:

 You should not have had access to confidential material under terms
 and conditions that preclude contributing to the development of
 Sable-UQAM projects.  Having agreed to the Sun community source
 license (SCSL) or any similar non-disclosure agreement, for example,
 would be such a situation.

2- You ARE the copyright holder of all work you contribute to the
project.

 Explanations:

 Your university or your employer (if you have one) might be the real
 copyright holder, if you are paid to do the work or if your
 university got you to sign a document accepting a school policy that
 all student programs are the property of the university.

 You must be the copyright holder on code you contribute.  If you wish
 to contribute code that you have written but for which you are not
 the sole copyright holder, then arrangements with all the copyright
 holders must take place before you are allowed to contribute this
 work.

 You are not allowed contribute any code for which you are not the
 copyright holder, even if that code is under a compatible license.
 If you need to contribute code that depends on a third-party library
 under compatible license, then you must take arrangement with us
 first.

3- You confirm that you license all work you contribute to the project
   under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, or under the license
   terms of the module you are contributing to, if different.

 Explanations:

 Copyright assignment from a contributor is not asked for.  A
 consequence of this policy is that the contributor remains the
 copyright holder on the code he himself writes, and can thus license
 it separately to other parties under any other license.

4- You give the Sable-UQAM Research Group the right to make changes
and add clarifications to the license terms of your contributed work.
Any change will be made with the objective of ensuring that:

   (a) it is possible to develop proprietary derivative works, and

   (b) the work qualifies as free software, as defined by the Free
   Software Foundation, by providing users the four kinds of freedom
   outlined at http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html, and

   (c) the work qualifies as free software according to the Debian
   Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) at
   http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines.

 Explanations:

 Free and open source software licenses evolve over time.  It is
 likely that new versions of the Apache License will be written.  We
 ask for your permission to change the license terms so that we do not
 have to contact you, years from now, to use newer licenses.  Yet, for
 protecting the freedom of you contributed code, we put clear
 restrictions on the kind of license terms we are allowed to chose.

5- You agree to these terms for ALL works you contribute to the
project.

 Explanations:

 If we give you an account in our code repository, these terms apply
 to all code you add into the repository, whether the code is part of
 the main source tree of Sable-UQAM projects or just a directory in
 your sandbox.  Of course, if you do not wish to work under these
 terms, there is no obligation for you to use the repository or to
 contribute your work.

 If you have a sandbox in the code repository, you may not add papers,
 reports, and theses to your sandbox.  Mainly, your sandbox is a
 publicly accessible place, with Apache License 2.0 stuff in it.
 Please do not put any binaries into the repository.  However,
 technical notes and documents that serve as project documentation
 must be licensed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0 and put in
 your sandbox (in source form), so that they can be modified to
 reflect changes as the project matures.
